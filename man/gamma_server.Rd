\title{Gamma Server Response Time Data}
\format{
A data frame with 1000 rows and 11 variables:
\describe{
\item{response_time_ms}{Server response time in milliseconds (continuous, positive, right-skewed)}
\item{concurrent_users}{Number of simultaneous users accessing the server (1-500)}
\item{database_queries}{Number of database calls per request (1-20)}
\item{cache_hit_rate}{Percentage of requests served from cache (30.0-98.0)}
\item{server_load}{CPU utilization percentage (10.0-95.0)}
\item{time_of_day}{Hour of day when request occurred (0-23)}
\item{day_of_week}{Day of week (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday)}
\item{geographic_region}{User's geographic location (North_America, Europe, Asia_Pacific, South_America, Africa)}
\item{request_complexity}{Type of page or operation complexity (Simple, Moderate, Complex)}
\item{cdn_usage}{Content delivery network utilization (Yes = CDN used, No = direct server)}
\item{memory_usage}{RAM utilization percentage (20.0-90.0)}
}
}
\usage{
gamma_server
}
\description{
A dataset containing website server response time data for gamma regression analysis.
}
\note{
This dataset is designed for gamma regression analysis where the outcome variable is response_time_ms, which follows a gamma distribution typical of performance metrics. The data includes realistic relationships between server load, user demand, and system performance factors commonly found in web application monitoring.
